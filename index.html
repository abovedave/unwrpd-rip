<h1>Wrapping up Unwrpd</h1>
<p>2017-2021</p>

<p><strong>After 5 years of examining what the future of consumption could be, <em>unwrpd.com</em> is shutting down from XX March 2020.</strong></p>

<p>Our mission was to make the plastic-free, zero-waste lifestyle as convenient as possible. We think we got pretty close but ultimately this was only a part-time project which we can no longer dedicate time to.</p>

<p>Coincidentally <em>Unwrpd</em> was founded only a few miles from the former location of the <a href="https://rawmaterials.bowarts.org/collection/site-of-parkesine-works/">Parkesine Works</a>, the factory where plastic was first mass produced in the 1860s. The wild popularity of the material couldn’t have been predicted, nor could our addiction to it as a civilisation. Awareness of the overuse of plastic has never been higher and thanks tothis there has never been more choice of alternatives available to the consumer. We feel proud to have been a small part
of this awakening.</p>

<p>Building <em>Unwrpd</em> has been a great way for us to explore what the future of consumption looks like. The choices we make as individual consumers contribute to trends which influence the products that are available to us. Every pound, dollar, and euro you spend is a vote for the world you want to live in. We want to thank our suppliers and customers for taking this journey with us.</p>

<p>For the curious, the spiritual successor to <em>Unwrpd</em> is <a href="https://joinbeagle.com/">Beagle</a>, a project we have both contributed to in some way. It’s a simple way for you to shop more ethically online.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br><br>Daniel &amp; David<br>Founders</p>
